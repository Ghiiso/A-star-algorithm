> live server is required to run this page

simple webpage to test A* algo. Draw start, end and obstacles by clicking on S, E and O buttons. Once start and end are placed you can run the algorithm by pressing the **TRACE** button. You can choose to display discarded paths by clicking on the checkbox undeneath the buttons. 

## A* algorithm
A* algorithm is a path search algorithm wich allows to find the optimal path between two points in presence of obstacles

### Discarded paths
Discarded paths are paths followed by the algo that have been subsequently discarded in favor of a shorter one
